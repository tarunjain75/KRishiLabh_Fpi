An app to connect FPI(Food Processing Industries) directly with Domestic Retailers


The idea is to connect FPI directly with the Domestic Retailers in India and ease the business process between them. This application is for the FPI(Food Processing Industries)

Through this app the FPI can sell their products directly to the Domestic Retailers. Initially FPI have to update their products details on the app.
Then through the KrishiLabh_Retailer app the retailers search for the FPI in nearby and then place order with the specific FPi. The order placing confirmation is recieved by this app in the notification panel.
Once the FPI approve the request the coresponding retailer is ready to proceed for the Payment process.
